# Part 1a — Data Sources

The following datasets were reviewed for Indian-language ASR training and evaluation.

| Dataset                                | Languages                     |               Approx. Hours | Speech Type                        | Code-Mixed                       | License / Access              | Purpose               |

### Dataset observations

* Large datasets such as **IndicVoices, Kathbath, Shrutilipi, and Vistaar** are primarily useful for training and broad evaluation.
* **MUCS Hindi-English** provides an explicit Hindi-English code-switching condition.
* **Gram Vaani** provides natural, telephone-quality Hindi speech.
* **Lahaja** provides additional Hindi accent and regional variation.
* **Vistaar** combines multiple datasets and domains, making it useful for broader evaluation.

### Recommended evaluation sets

For evaluating Hindi ASR under realistic call-like and mixed-language conditions:

1. **MUCS Hindi-English** — explicit Hindi-English code-switching.
2. **Gram Vaani** — spontaneous telephone-quality Hindi with real-world acoustic variation.
3. **Lahaja** — Hindi accent and extempore speech diversity.

These datasets provide complementary evaluation conditions rather than representing one identical test set.

# Part 1b — Models

Five open-source ASR models were selected for the benchmark.

| Model                        | Architecture / Family   | Language Coverage              | Long-Audio Handling                |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Whisper large-v3-turbo**   | Whisper                 | Multilingual                   | 30-second chunks / stride          |
| **Fine-tuned Whisper Hindi** | Whisper fine-tuned      | Hindi                          | 30-second chunks                   |
| **IndicConformer 600M**      | Conformer / CTC         | 22 Indian languages            | 45-second chunks                   |
| **SraVaani 1.0**             | FastConformer / TDT-CTC | 65 Indian languages / dialects | 30-second chunks with overlap      |
| **NVIDIA Nemotron 3.5**      | FastConformer / RNNT    | Multilingual including Hindi   | Processor-defined streaming chunks |

Model cards were reviewed for:

* Languages used during training
* Tokenizer and output-script behavior
* Model architecture
* Supported input duration
* Long-audio/chunking behavior

All benchmark inference is performed locally. Customer audio should not be sent to external commercial APIs.

## Inference Problems and Solutions

### 1. Long-audio inference

Whisper and some Conformer-based models do not directly process arbitrarily long audio.

**Solution:** Audio is split into model-compatible chunks:

* Whisper: 30-second chunks with stride
* SraVaani: 30-second chunks with overlap
* IndicConformer: 45-second chunks
* Nemotron: processor-defined streaming chunks

### 2. ONNX long-sequence errors

Long Conformer audio caused attention / positional-encoding sequence-length mismatches.

**Solution:** Split long recordings into 45-second or smaller chunks while retaining the expected model input signature.

### 3. Incorrect model input

Passing additional `length` tensors to some model interfaces resulted in invalid or `None` inputs.

**Solution:** Use the model's expected call signature, for example:

```python
model(audio_tensor, language, "ctc")
```

### 4. Slow inference

Repeated model initialization significantly increased runtime.

**Solution:**

* Load each model once
* Reuse the model across evaluation slices
* Batch inference where supported
* Use optimized attention/runtime options where supported

# Part 1c — How to Evaluate

## Indian-Language ASR Benchmark

This project benchmarks five open-source ASR models on the audio in `data/`. It reports **word error rate (WER), character error rate (CER), and real-time factor (RTF)** for three slices:

* `clean`: original audio
* `telephony`: controlled telephone-bandwidth/noise simulation
* `code_mixed`: references containing both Devanagari and Latin-script words

The benchmark is intended for Hindi and Hindi-English speech, including long-form and telephony-style audio.

## Setup

From the repository root in PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv

.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

pip install numpy soundfile psutil torch huggingface_hub nemo_text_processing

pip install --upgrade transformers
```

The scripts download models from Hugging Face on first use. Authenticate when a gated model requests access:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\huggingface-cli.exe login
```

CUDA is used automatically when available; otherwise the scripts run on CPU.

The audio directory and ground truth default to:

```text
data/
data\gt.txt
```

The Nemotron runner uses `AutoModelForRNNT`; use an up-to-date Transformers release. If the import fails, rerun:

```powershell
pip install --upgrade transformers
```

before running the complete benchmark.

---

# Run the Complete Benchmark

The deliverable is one results table:

**model × slice → WER / CER / RTF**

All five evaluations can be reproduced with one command:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\run_benchmark.ps1
```

When PowerShell is already being used:

```powershell
.\run_benchmark.ps1
```

The wrapper runs every model with:

```text
--evaluate
--data-dir data
--ground-truth data\gt.txt
```

and writes fresh JSON files into:

```text
modelbenchmark_day1/
```

---

# Run Models Individually

Run these commands from the repository root:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe modelcodesday1\whisperltv3.py --data-dir data --evaluate --ground-truth data\gt.txt --evaluation-output modelbenchmark_day1\whisperevaluation_results.json

.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe modelcodesday1\whisper_fintuned.py --data-dir data --evaluate --ground-truth data\gt.txt --evaluation-output modelbenchmark_day1\ftwhisper_evaluation.json

.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe modelcodesday1\indicconfor.py --data-dir data --evaluate --ground-truth data\gt.txt --batch-size 1 --evaluation-output modelbenchmark_day1\indicconfor_evaluation.json

.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe modelcodesday1\sraavani.py --data-dir data --evaluate --ground-truth data\gt.txt --batch-size 4 --chunk-seconds 30 --overlap-seconds 1 --evaluation-output modelbenchmark_day1\sravaani_evaluation.json

.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe modelcodesday1\transcriber_nemotron.py --data-dir data --evaluate --ground-truth data\gt.txt --lookahead-tokens 6 --evaluation-output modelbenchmark_day1\evaluation_results_nemotron.json
```

For transcription without scoring, omit `--evaluate` and provide:

```text
--output path.jsonl
```

Model-specific options can be viewed with:

```powershell
python modelcodesday1\<script>.py --help
```

# Evaluation Slices

### Clean

Original evaluation audio without additional transformations.

### Telephony

The same audio is transformed to simulate telephone conditions:

* Downsample to 8 kHz
* Apply narrowband / μ-law characteristics
* Add controlled noise
* Upsample back to the model's expected sampling rate

### Code-Mixed

Evaluation uses references containing both:

* **Devanagari-script words**
* **Latin-script English words**

This slice is intended to measure Hindi-English code-mixed recognition and script behavior.

---

# Metrics

The benchmark reports:

* **WER** — Word Error Rate
* **CER** — Character Error Rate
* **RTF** — Real-Time Factor
* **Peak CPU memory**

For code-mixed speech, additional analysis includes:

* Mixed error rate
* CER on Devanagari
* WER on Latin-script words
* English-word accuracy
* Wrong-script rate

Normalization is applied consistently before scoring. Indic vowel signs are preserved, while punctuation and number-formatting differences are handled according to the documented normalization policy.

---

# Results

Values below are aggregate metrics read from the JSON files in `modelbenchmark_day1/`.

WER and CER are error rates. RTF is mean inference time divided by audio duration. Lower values indicate lower error or lower inference time.

`n` is the number of evaluated recordings.
